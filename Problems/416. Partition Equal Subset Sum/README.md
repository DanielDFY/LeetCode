# Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given a **non-empty** array containing **only positive integers**, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
> Output: true
> Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
> 
> Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]
> Output: false
> Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
> ```

**Note:**

1. Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
2. The array size will not exceed 200.



**Idea:** 

The basic idea is to understand that to partition an array into two subsets of equal sum say `subSetSum`, the `totalSum` of given array must be twice the `subSetSum`. We only need to fine if there is a possible conbination which sums up to `subSetSum`. Also the size of input numbers should be even.



To find possible conbination, sort the input numbers (so we can trim searching early) and do DFS from the start.

\text{totalSum} = \text{subsSetSum} * 2totalSum=subsSetSumâˆ—2

This could also be written as, \text{subSetSum} = \text{totalSum}/2subSetSum=totalSum/2



Time complexity: O(N<sup>2</sup>)

Space complexity: O(N).

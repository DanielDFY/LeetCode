# Longest Palindromic Substring

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

```
string convert(string s, int numRows);
```

> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
> Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
> Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
> Explanation:
> 
> P     I    N
> A   L S  I G
> Y A   H R
> P     I
> ```



**Idea:**

We can construct the final result by visiting row-by-row. In each row, there can be two kinds of characters(in the straight/tilted column). So we can get them by adding offsets based on the position of each straight column. Suppose `i`th row is visited, the index of the character in the straight/tilted column should be `columnIndex +/- i` (tilted column is before straight column, except the first and last column where they will overlap).

Time Complexity: O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1) if return string is not considered extra space.
